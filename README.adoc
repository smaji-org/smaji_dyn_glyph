= Smaji_dyn_glyph

Smaji_dyn_glyph is an open source, versatile processor for parsing, generating and converting glyph files.

1. convert between svg(used in font editor) and glif(used in Unified Font Object) files
2. generate glyph outline from god files
3. generate glyph animation from god files

== Installation

[source,]
opam install smaji_dyn_glyph

== Usage

=== Converting

Due to the design of glif file that it cannot embed other glif inside, but only references others, complicated svg files, e.g. svg files contain `<g/>` container, cannot be converted to glif file directly.

convert the format of outline files

  smaji_dyn_glyph convert 

=== flags ===

  --source-type type, --st   . convert from the type. available types: svg, glif
  --target-type type, --tt   . convert to the type. available types: svg, glif
  [--input filename], -i     . input filename, default to stdin
  [--output filename], -o    . output filename, default to stdout
  [-help], -?                . print this help text and exit

=== Glyph generating

To generate glyph outline or animation files, smaji_dyn_glyph needs two directories containing stroke or animation components respectively. And if the god file being processed references any other god files as components, a directory containing god files is also required.

https://github.com/smaji-org/smaji_dyn_glyph_sample[smaji_dyn_glyph_sample] is such a sample containing both components and gods files. The directories in this repository can be used in the commands as follows.

Suppose that smaji_dyn_glyph_sample has already been checked out in current directory, then

[source,]
smaji_dyn_glyph outline glif \
    --god-dir smaji_dyn_glyph_sample/components/gods \
    --component-dir smaji_dyn_glyph_sample/components/outlines

will read the god file from `stdin` and output the glif file to `stdout`,

[source,]
smaji_dyn_glyph animation \
    --unicode 4e15,0 \
    --output 4e15,0.animation.svg \
    --god-dir smaji_dyn_glyph_sample/components/gods \
    --component-dir smaji_dyn_glyph_sample/components/outlines

will read the god file from `smaji_dyn_glyph_sample/components/gods/4e15/0/default.xml` and output the svg animation file to `4e15,0.animation.svg`.

      Rotate180

Also due to the design of glif file that it cannot embed other glif inside, but only references others, for each transformed glyph, horizontally mirrored, vertically mirrored or rotated, two glif files are generated, one is the content, another is the wrap used to transform the content. Hence the output file name is also forced to be `<user specified output name>.glif` and `<user specified ouput name>_content.glif` respectively. And if the output file is `stdin`, the wrap and the content are output to `stdin` one after another.
